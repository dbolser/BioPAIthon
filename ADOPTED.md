# Work adopted from upstream

Biopython has 142 open pull requests, some of them years old. A number are
finished, reviewed and approved, and are held up only because a maintainer
asked whether an AI tool was involved. This fork does not ask that question, so
it can take them.

This file records every one, who wrote it, what was taken, and what was left
behind. Nothing here is this fork's work.

## How this is done, and why the history is kept

Adopted commits are **cherry-picked, not retyped**. Git records the original
author in the commit's `Author` field and this fork only as `Committer`, so
`git log --format='%an'` names the person who actually wrote the code and
`git blame` keeps pointing at them. Authors are added to `CONTRIB.rst`.

The licence basis is upstream's own pull request template, which every
contributor ticks:

> I hereby agree to dual licence this and any previous contributions under
> both the *Biopython License Agreement* **AND** the *BSD 3-Clause License*.

That makes the work BSD-3 and adoptable here. **The box is checked on each
pull request before anything is taken from it** — a few upstream PRs leave it
unticked, and those are not eligible however good they are.

Adopting is not endorsing. Where a pull request grew a change under review that
this fork does not want, only the wanted commits are taken, and the omission is
recorded below with the reason.

## Adopted

### [#5175](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/pull/5175) — Abdel ATIA

Replaces nine `assert` statements that validate input in production code with
explicit `if`/`raise`, in `Bio/ExPASy/Enzyme.py`, `Bio/ExPASy/ScanProsite.py`,
`Bio/SeqIO/TabIO.py` and `Bio/motifs/alignace.py`. Under `python -O` every one
of those checks vanishes, so a malformed file produces silently wrong output
rather than an error — the same defect `IMPROVEMENTS.md` §0.8 describes across
343 sites. Four commits, all taken, tests included.

Approved by mdehoon on 2026-03-18 and peterjc on 2026-04-27 ("The changes look
good, thank you"). The requested `assertRaises` tests were added on 2026-05-01.
The thread then stopped at "is something funny about your recent comments - are
you using a coding agent LLM AI tool?" and has not moved since.
